Uses the Conceptinetic DMX shield to receive DMX data and control 3 servos on pins 9, 10 & 11.

Shield was obtained from here: https://www.dfrobot.com/product-984.html?search=dmx&description=true

Works well, will update in a future release to have OLED screen to set DMX address rather than setting it in code.
