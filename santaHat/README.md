Runs various patterns around a santa hat, selectable with a push button.

Built for a "large" size hat, using a strip of WS2812 pixels (total of 35 at 60/m) but configurable for other sizes - just update NUM_LEDS. 

Originally built with an Arduino Nano, using pin D2 for data out to LEDs, and push button between GND & A5.
